Spring Boot project with Spring Webflux and Spring Cloud. The config client is working (you will see it reach out to localhost:8888 for some configuration data on startup). The /features endpoint is also working, but some other things are not compatible with a regular JVM (for instance there seems to be an issue with discovery client being present but not triggering a load balancer to be created).
